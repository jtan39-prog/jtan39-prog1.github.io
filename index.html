        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jamison, a student-athlete with a passion in econ-accounting!</p>

        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>I currently attend Claremont McKenna College. I am currently in my junior year, balancing athletics and academics. I enjoy gaining new knowledge, meeting new people, and challenging myself in new ways.
            CMC has taught me how to be proficient at time management, organization, and feasible study habits.</p>

        <h2>Golf</h2>
        <p>I started playing golf at the age of 5. I have spent the past 2 years as a member of the golf team, and am passionate about competing in the spring season. Golf has taught me many thigns throughout the years, such as focus, patience, and consistency. 
            When I'm at the golf course, it gives me a sense of relaxation and comfort away from school. Golf is somewhere I can always take a moment to relax in.</p>

    <section class="bio">
        <h2>Being a Student-Athlete</h2>
        <p>As a student-athlete,I've learned how to balance school and sports, trying to progress at both simultaneously. Being a student-athlete means staying on top of school while also taking time to perfect your sport. You need to be committed and driven to succeed. 
            Some things I've learned from sports can translate directly into academics, such as discipline. Discipline helps me stay on top of things, and makes me proud of the work I put in to succeed in both areas of my life.</p>
